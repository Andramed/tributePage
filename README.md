# Tribut page 
  The primary objective of the Tribute Page project is to create a personalized web application that pays tribute to a person or chosen subject, aligning with a specific set of user stories and requirements. This project is designed to showcase your skills and accomplishments, especially since it was one of my initial projects created in accordance with the technical requirements provided by FreeCodeCamp. This initiative reflects the desire to explore and become familiar with structuring and styling a basic web page in a coherent and concrete manner.
